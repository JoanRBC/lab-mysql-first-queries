Question #7:

The results were expected, as the first two best rated apps belong to the social networking genre, as observed on question #2.

Question #8:

Although the top 10 apps have the highest user rating, the ten that follow (LIMIT 20) also had it. Not much to be concluded.

Question #9:

Non of the highest user rated apps appear to be in the most rated apps list, and vice-versa. The highest user rated apps may
not be as popular, and although the most rated apps may not have the highest user rate, they have many users.

Question #10:

We could see the intersection (inner join), sorting the highest_count_tot and the user_rating by DESC.

Question #11:

Using the columns: (track_name , rating_count_tot , user_rating , price) and sorting the price(first query) and the 
rating_count_tot(second query) by DESC and LIMIT 20, we can conclude that the user_rating is pretty similar for free/not free apps. 
Thus, the price does not have a significant impact in the users rate. It does have an impact in the total count of ratings (highest values 
are mainly observed for free apps).
